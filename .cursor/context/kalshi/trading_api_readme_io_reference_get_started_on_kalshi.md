To make your request we recommend testing a public endpoint like [GetMarkets](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getmarkets-1). As you explore our other endpoints, you'll notice some endpoints return an `authentication_error`. If you want to experiment with these endpoints, you will need to get [API Keys](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/api-keys). You may also want to sign up for a [demo account](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/creating-a-demo-account) to test without real funds.

The following resources might help you on your journey to exploring Kalshi's markets:

- [Python starter code](https://github.com/Kalshi/kalshi-starter-code-python/tree/main) bare-bones API interactions with authentication examples (also see [API Keys](https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/api-keys))
- [Python starter code 2](https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/KalshiAPIStarterCodeWithApiKey.zip) this Python client is not maintained, but you may still find it useful as a reference for how to call certain endpoints
